The following are used as the dummy addresses to send and transfer fund.

```Python
Dummy account1 address: 0x0c0669Cd5e60a6F4b8ce437E4a4A007093D368Cb
Dummy account2 address: 0x7A1f3dFAa0a4a19844B606CD6e91d693083B12c0
```

Next, the following 3 transactions are tested on the left side of the screen.

- Transaction 1: Send 1 ether as wei.
